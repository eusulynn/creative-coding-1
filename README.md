Welcome to Su Lynn's creative coding with vanilla JavaScript where she explores the canvas to create randomized fractals!

1. I created a Fractal class as a template for creating objects, of which variables and functions are bundled in ( encapsulation of OOP).
2. I made a constuctor method to hold the canvcas width and height arguments as well as to hold properties such as the size, spread, branches, and color etc of the fractal.
3. I made a draw method to draw a shape based on the given values of the method.
4. I made a drawline a private helper method (abstraction concept of OOP) that handles drawing of a single line/fractal branch
5. Within the drawline I made recursions to handle fractal branches.
6. Now, everytime you refresh the page, a new fractal will appear!
